# [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) vs [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift)

## Pros of Rancher

- 100% free and open source
- no vendor lock in, clean uninstall offered
- more intuitive website, easier to grasp at a glance what Rancher offers
- supports many k8s distributions
- possibility of managing multiple k8s clusters with centralised RBAC

## Cons of Rancher

- none found

## Pros of OpenShift

- ability to deploy code in one of the supported languages/frameworks with little to no knowledge of Kubernetes
- built on top of an open-source Kubernetes distribution: okd
- tried and tested enterprise solution

## Cons of OpenShift

- not open source, presumably not free either, website does not explicitly provide pricing information

## Verdict

Rancher is more in spirit with the Cloud Native ideology, providing a free and open source experience, backed by sponsors.
They are also much more transparent and developer friendly, as I've had an easier time finding out the information I wanted from their website, than from OpenShift's. It's easy to find their guide on [how to set up Rancher](https://rancher.com/quick-start).
